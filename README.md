This repo contains:
- a version of Comparalem, the R program for grapho-phonological analysis I developed. The program is still undergoing development, so this version is just a functional snapshot of it. It is the version I used for my talk at DIACHRO XI congress;
- the data I extracted from the NCA4 corpus for this talk;
- many graphics and tables produced by the program for this talk;
- the slides of this talk.
